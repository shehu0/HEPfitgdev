HEPfit - a Fitting Tool for the Standard Model and Beyond
===========================================================================

version in progress
-------------------
For SusyFit-0.2 (released before the SusyFit-to-HEPfit renaming) GNU
Build version, please see
https://github.com/silvest/HEPfit/tree/SusyFit-0.2_GNU_version
or the cmake version http://hepfit.roma1.infn.it/SusyFit-0.2.tar.gz 

HEPfit is a flexible tool which, given the Standard Model or any extension,
allows to:

  - fit the model parameters to a given set of experimental observables
  - obtain fit results for observables
  - obtain predictions for observables

HEPfit can be used:

  - as an executable in Monte Carlo mode, to perform a Bayesian Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo analysis of the given model
  - as an executable in single event mode, to obtain predictions of observables
    for a given point in the parameter space of the model
  - in library mode, to obtain predictions of observables for a given point
    in the parameter space of the model, allowing our computational tool to
    be used in any statistical framework

The Monte Carlo mode is based on the BAT (Bayesian Analysis Toolkit) library.

Availability:
-------------
HEPfit is available from [the HEPfit webpage](http://hepfit.roma1.infn.it/).
See COPYING file for licensing terms.

Installation:
-------------
HEPfit can be built by either using the "./configure;make" method or
using CMake. The first method is the one applicable for this GNU Build
version of the HEPfit. It should work on all Unix-like machines
but will require the cygwin environment for it to work on Windows
machines. For using cmake, please refer to https://github.com/silvest/HEPfit.  

To compile and install HEPfit, the following have to be availabled installed:
GSL, LoopTools, Boost, ROOT, BAT and FeynHiggs. The current version in
progress is compatible with FeynHiggs v2.11.2 or v2.10.0 only! If all
these are installed in the default install prefix (/usr/local) then
run the following commands to install HEPfit into /usr/local: 

	./configure
	make -j 4
	make install

To chose a non-default directory where HEPfit will be installed, set
the prefix (default is /usr/local) with --prefix=/custom/install/path
argument to configure. Likewise to set a non-default directory where
BAT, for example, is installed, set the --with-bat=/custom/path
argument to configure. An example is 

	./configure --prefix=/install/path --with-bat=/BATinstall/dir 
	
Read the output of the command 'configure --help' for the list of
options and environment variables that can be passed to configure.

See the INSTALL file for detailed installation instructions.

Support:
--------
There is not yet a manual for HEPfit. For additional information and
contacting the authors, please, consult [the HEPfit
