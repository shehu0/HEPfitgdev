/* NOTE TO DOCUMENTERS: 
 *
 * 1. The block @addtogroup is only necessary in one header file
 *    in any project group. This has to be the first header file when they are sorted
 *    alphabetically by their names.
 *
 * 2. Please try to stick to the conventions set in this header file. In particular 
 *    please note that:
 *      a. @brief and @detail are written in complete sentences starting with a
 *         capital letter and ending with a period
 *      b. @param[in/out] and @return are incomplete sentences not ending in a 
 *         period and starting with a small letter.
 *      c. Object and variable descriptions should be complete sentences starting
 *         with a capital letter and ending with a period. These descriptions
 *         should be inline.
 *      d. All public, protected and private members should be documented including
 *         variables and objects
 *      e. If the class member has a complicated algorithm please try to explain it
 *         clearly with the use of @li:
 *       @li Step 1
 *       @li Step 2
 *       ...
 *         etc. 
 *      f. If you make any rule that is not specified here, please add it and
 *         broadcast it.
 *
 * 3. Make sure you use linking to other classes and members liberally:
 *    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/autolink.html
 *
 * 4. Please put in references to the literature where deserving with @cite command, 
 *    and also point out deviations from normal conventions or routines.  
 *
 *    The references have to be added to a bib file Doxygen/<somename>.bib, where the 
 *    following manipulations have to be made: 
 *	
 *	(i) The title should be in a single line. More specifically, make sure that any 
 *	    mathematical equation is in a single line and not split up.
 *
 * 5. Documentation is now generated by bibconversion.pl. For usage instructions (listed
 *    below) run ‘’perl bibconversion.pl’ at the terminal. This is done so that the 
 *    bibliography is generated correctly. One can run doxygen natively too.
 *
 *       USAGE:
 *       perl bibconversion.pl <list of input bibtex files (*.bib)> [-o[-of]] [<output bibtex file (<output>.bib)>] [-dox Doxyfile]
 *   
 *       The option specifications are positional.
 *       The above format must be followed if the options are used.
 *   
 *       -o      Specifies the output file name. (MUST end in .bib)
 *       -of     Deletes the output file if it exists.
 *       -dox    Specifies the Doxygen configuration file from the commandline
 *   
 *       Default Output File HEPfit.bib can be specified with:
 *       perl $program <list of input bibtex files (*.bib)> [-of]
